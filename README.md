<p align="left">This project includes a simple Python program that shows how basic classification works step by step. Instead of using any machine learning libraries, everything is done manually with pure Python so you can clearly see the logic behind it.<br>The program uses a matrix-based approach to organize and compare predicted vs. actual results, helping visualize how data is categorized. It then displays the outcomes in a clear and easy-to-understand format.<br>In short, this project is meant to teach the core idea of classification how data is grouped, how results are calculated, and how accuracy is measured all in a way that’s beginner-friendly and transparent.</p>
